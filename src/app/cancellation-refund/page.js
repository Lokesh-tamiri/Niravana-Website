        <h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: November 27, 2025</p>
        <p>
          This Cancellation and Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions
          under which Niravana accepts cancellations and processes refunds for
          our services. By engaging with our services, you agree to the terms
          outlined in this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Niravana provides customized digital services including web
          development, mobile application development, AI solutions, and
          branding services. Due to the bespoke nature of our work and the
          resources committed to each project, our cancellation and refund
          policy is structured to be fair to both our clients and our team.
        </p>

        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        
        <h3>Project Cancellation Before Commencement</h3>

          before any design, development, or creative work has started):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>

              payment processing fees (typically 2-3% of transaction amount)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>After 24 hours but before project kickoff:</strong> 80%
              refund to cover administrative and setup costs

          initiated), cancellation charges apply based on project progress:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Up to 25% project completion:</strong> 30% of total
              project value is non-refundable
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>

              project value is non-refundable
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>

              project value is non-refundable
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Over 75% project completion:</strong> No refund available

        <h2>Project Modifications vs Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of cancelling, you may request project modifications. Please
          note:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Minor scope changes within the original project framework are
            typically accommodated at no extra charge
          </li>
          <li>
            Major scope changes may require a revised contract and additional
            payment
          </li>
          <li>
            Multiple revision rounds beyond those specified in the contract may
            incur additional fees
          </li>
          <li>
            We encourage open communication to adjust projects rather than
            cancel them
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services and Products</h2>
        <p>
          For third-party services, licenses, or products purchased on your
          behalf (domain names, hosting, premium plugins, stock images, API
          subscriptions, etc.):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These costs are non-refundable as they are purchased from external
            vendors
          </li>
          <li>
            Refund eligibility is subject to the third-party vendor's refund
            policy
          </li>
          <li>
            We will transfer ownership of any purchased licenses or services to
            you upon cancellation
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          If you disagree with a refund decision or have a dispute regarding
          cancellation charges:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First, contact us at operations@niravana.in with your concerns
          </li>
          <li>
            We will attempt to resolve the issue through good faith negotiation
          </li>
          <li>
            If resolution cannot be reached, disputes will be handled according
            to the Dispute Resolution clause in our Terms and Conditions
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Force Majeure</h2>
        <p>
          In the event of force majeure circumstances (natural disasters,
          pandemics, war, government restrictions, etc.) that prevent project
          completion:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We will work with you to reschedule or restructure the project
          </li>
          <li>
            Refunds will be considered on a case-by-case basis for work not yet
            commenced
          </li>
          <li>
            No refunds will be issued for work already completed before the
            force majeure event
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Client-Caused Delays</h2>
        <p>
          If a project is delayed or stalled due to client-side issues
          (non-responsiveness, delayed feedback, failure to provide required
          materials), and the project remains inactive for more than 60 days:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We reserve the right to consider the project abandoned with no
            refund
          </li>
          <li>All work completed up to that point will be delivered to you</li>
          <li>
            Reactivation of abandoned projects may require additional fees
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chargeback Policy</h2>
        <p>
          If you initiate a chargeback through your bank or payment provider
          instead of contacting us directly:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We will provide evidence of service delivery to your payment
            provider
          </li>
          <li>Access to all deliverables and services will be suspended</li>
          <li>
            Chargeback fees charged to us by payment processors will be added
            to any outstanding balance
          </li>
          <li>
            Future services may be declined if chargebacks are filed without
            attempting resolution with us first
          </li>
        </ul>
